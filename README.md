## Hi there 👋  I'm Thomas 😉

- 💻 I've been coding for over 3 years and have enjoyed every second of it. One of my most rewarding experiences was building my first website called vizz using Go, taking it from scratch to a fully deployable site on the internet. The process was exciting, and it solidified my passion for backend web development.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Go and C++, diving deeper into creating efficient, high-performing systems. My recent project, was using simple mathematics to make an AI that never loses in the game of pong.

- 🍁 I'm actively seeking an opportunity in backend web development, with a strong preference for working with Go or Python. My ideal role would be at a dynamic startup, collaborating closely with a small, dedicated team where I can contribute meaningfully and see the impact of my work. If you're building something exciting and need a passionate developer, I'd love to connect!

If you're hiring, let's chat! 🚀
