## Hi there 👋  I'm Thomas 😉

- 💻 I've been coding for over 3 years and have enjoyed every second of it. One of my most rewarding experiences was building my first deployed website on the internet called vizz using Go, taking it from scratch. The process was exciting, and it solidified my passion for backend web development.

- 🌱  I'm currently learning Go and C++, diving deeper into creating efficient, high-performing systems. My recent project involved building a compiler in c++ that compiles Tiny language and emits c++ code. I have to say, Go makes me feel so productive, while C++ makes me re-evaluate my life decisions—but when it works, I feel like I could fly. Then there's Python; which feels like a cheat code.
  
- 🍁 I'm actively seeking an opportunity in backend web development, with a strong preference for working with Go or Python. My ideal role would be at a dynamic startup, collaborating closely with a small, dedicated team where I can contribute meaningfully and see the impact of my work. If you're building something exciting and need a passionate developer, I'd love to connect!

If you're hiring, let's chat! 🚀
